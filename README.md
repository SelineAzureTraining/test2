# TIXClock
A TIXClock is a colour clock that uses a number of lights to indicate time. This TIXClock uses a simple table with squares. Each increment the colour of the boxes change and the position. Only the amount of lit boxes is a representation of the time.

This is a project made in 2005 so the html an javascript are pretty ancient. Feel free to improve and contribute.
